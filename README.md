# Password Manager GUI:
The Password Manager GUI project is a Python-based desktop application that helps users securely store, generate, and retrieve passwords. Built with the Tkinter library, it features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for managing passwords efficiently. Users can add, search for, and generate secure passwords, making it an essential tool for maintaining online security.

# Key Features:
## Secure Password Generation:

1. Generates strong, randomized passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. Automatically copies generated passwords to the clipboard for ease of use.

## Data Storage:

1. Stores passwords in a JSON file, ensuring easy access and updating.
2. Supports adding multiple website credentials (email/username and password).

## Password Retrieval:

1. Quickly searches for stored passwords by website name.
2. Provides user-friendly alerts for missing or non-existent data.

## User-Friendly GUI:

1. Built using Tkinter for a responsive and visually appealing interface.
2. Includes entry fields, labels, and buttons for seamless user interaction.

## Error Handling:

1. Handles missing or empty input fields with error messages.
2. Detects and manages missing data files gracefully.

## Steps Performed:

### Imported Libraries:

1. json: For managing password data storage in a JSON file.
2. tkinter: To create and manage the graphical interface.
3. messagebox: To display alerts and confirmations to users.
4. random: To randomize password characters.
5. pyperclip: To copy generated passwords to the clipboard.

### Implemented Core Functionalities:

1. Password generation logic using random.choice and list comprehensions.
2. File operations for reading, writing, and updating password data stored in data.json.
3. Password search functionality with a user-friendly prompt system.

### Designed GUI Layout:

1. Created a window using Tk with proper dimensions and padding.
2. Added a logo image to the canvas for visual enhancement.
3. Placed labels, entry fields, and buttons strategically for an intuitive layout.

### Ensured Smooth User Experience:

1. Added default placeholder email/username for convenience.
2. Enabled real-time feedback for user actions through messagebox.

### Technologies Used:

1. Python
2. Tkinter (GUI Framework)
3. JSON (Data Storage)
4. Pyperclip (Clipboard Interaction)

### Future Enhancements:
1. Encrypt password data for enhanced security.
2. Add user authentication for accessing the password manager.
3. Provide an export/import feature for managing large password datasets.
